## Unsure How To Help?

[Gitter][gitter] is the place for you!

## Improving The Documentation

Fork the [ENSIME site][ensime-site] on Github.

## Hacking on the Code

The source code is [on Github][ensime-sublime]. If you are hacking on ENSIME Sublime, there are a few things you may want to do differently.

### Installing Directly from Source

Rather than installing ENSIME Sublime via Package Control, check out the [Git repo][ensime-sublime] directly into the directory you end up in when you choose *Preferences / Browse Packages*.

This will Sublime Text to pick up changes in the plugin codebase live as you edit it!
