If you use ENSIME every day and want to make sure that it is sustainable and continues to get better, please consider sponsoring us.

ENSIME will always be free / libre software and primarily rely on our community for bugfixes and feature enhancements. But big changes take time that volunteers do not have, so we need to crowdfund it.

The following major features have been implemented under the sponsorship programme:

- [Graph Based Indexer](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/pull/1747) ([watch a talk about it](/talks/scalasphere17/))
- [Scala 2.12 support](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/pull/1703)
- [Analyzer per Project](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/pull/1807)
- [rewrite sublime plugin](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues/1778)

with more in [the current roadmap](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/projects/3).

Please consider setting up a monthly donation at [salt.bountysource.com/teams/ensime](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/ensime) (a [libre platform](https://github.com/bountysource/core)).

We'd like to extend a special thank you to the following sponsors:
